2014/15 model year
The official EPA range for the 2014 and 2015 model year Leaf, 
increased from 121 to 135 km (75 to 84 miles). The difference 
in range is due to a technicality, as Nissan decided to eliminate 
the EPA blended range rating, which was an average of the 80% charge 
range and the 100% charge range. For the 2014 model year, only the 100% 
charge range figure applies.

According to the EPA, the 2014 and 2015 model year Leafs have an energy 
consumption of 30 kWh/100 miles, for a combined city/highway rating of 
114 mpg-e (30 kW·h/100 mi; 18.7 kW·h/100 km); 
126 MPGe (27.3 kW·h/100 mi; 17.0 kW·h/100 km) city and 
101 MPGe (34.0 kW·h/100 mi; 21.2 kW·h/100 km) highway.
